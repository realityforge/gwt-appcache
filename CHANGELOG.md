## Unreleased
* Fix bug that allowed duplicates to appear in the cache if a resource is present
  as both a resource generate by GWT tool chain as well as a resource configured
  statically via the `appcache_static_files` property.

## 1.0.12:
* Make the `AbstractManifestServlet.getBaseUrl()` method and the
  `AbstractManifestServlet.getModuleName()` method protected so that they can be
  overridden in sub-classes. This allows alternative strategies such as embedding
  the selected locale in the manifest url. Submitted by Alex Bertram.

## 1.0.11:
* Rename `org.realityforge.gwt.appcache.server.gwtp.MobileUserAgentProvider` to
  `org.realityforge.gwt.appcache.server.gwtp.FormFactorPropertyProvider`

## 1.0.10:
* Add `org.realityforge.gwt.appcache.server.gwtp.MobileUserAgentProvider` that
  defines properties in a mechanism suitable for GWTP framework. Submitted by
  Andrea Granados.

## 1.0.9:
* Annotate ApplicationCache.getApplicationCacheIfSupported() with Nullable to
  make it clear that null can be returned.

## 1.0.8:
* Avoid including artifacts generated by com.google.gwt.precompress.Precompress
  linker in the manifest. Submitted by Pablo Nussembaum.

## 1.0.7:
* Fix bug in AbstractManifestServlet which results in a NullPointerException
  when a provider does not return a value. An example where this occurs is
  when a client-side property provider can also be derived on on the
  server-side when a cookie is set. Reported by Paul French.
* Add nullability annotations on to PropertyProvider interface to highlight
  incorrect usage.

## 1.0.6:
* Rather than returning a 500 response when the servlet is unable to locate
  and/or process the manifest files, return a 404. This ensures that the
  appcache manifest is removed from the client.
* Update the set of inherits clauses from .gwt.xml file to exclude
  "com.google.gwt.core.Core" that can be derived from other modules and to
  include "com.google.gwt.event.Event" as this is required by the project.

## 1.0.5:
* Update AbstractManifestServlet so it does not assume the file system and
  instead accesses manifests and the permutations descriptor via getResource()
  and getResourceAsStream().

## 1.0.4:
* Add support for fallback resources via the GWT configuration property
  'appcache_fallback_files'.

## 1.0.3:
* Create a LocalePropertyProvider.
* Import property providers and customized servlet compatible with MGWT framework.

## 1.0.2:
* Fix off by one error when encoding urls in manifest.

## 1.0.1:
* The deferred binding rule for disabling the appcache was tied to the storageSupport
  configuration property rather than the appcacheSupport configuration property. This
  has been fixed. This may have resulted in the code bloat with some older browser
  permutations.

## 1.0:
* Rename ApplicationCache.get to ApplicationCache.getApplicationCacheIfSupported
  for consistency with other frameworks.

## 0.9:
* Cache manifests rather than re-reading them from the filesystem and clear cache
  when permutations.xml is reloaded.
* Use deferred binding to control support for appcache capability.
* Reduce the set of module dependencies declared in the Appcache.gwt.xml file
  to the minimal set.
* Support the notion of client-side selection properties in AbstractManifestServlet.
  If one of these properties is not defined on the server-side then a merged
  manifest that covers all of the permutations that are matched is sent to the
  client and selection occurs on the client-side.
* Change PermutationsIO.deserialize() to return an unmodifiable list.

## 0.8:
* Support multiple selector properties when matching strong and weak permutations.
* Rename PermutationDescriptor to SelectionDescriptor to reflect actual semantics.
* Implement the ApplicationCache.abort() method for the sake of completeness.
* Clear the 'appcache_disable' cookie when instance of Html5ApplicationCache is
  initially created.

## 0.7:
* Remove no-store from Cache-control http header when returning manifest file
  to ensure Firefox can use the manifest file.
* Declare the character set in the content type of the manifest file to ensure
  file names are correctly decoded.
* Use the ProgressEvent.lengthComputable value to determine whether the browser
  has supplied the loaded and total fields on the event.
* Implement equals() and hashcode() on BindingProperty
* Add a utility method AbstractManifestServlet.loadAndMergeManifests that loads
  and merges the cache files for multiple permutations. This is useful when it
  is not possible to determine the exact permutation required for a client on
  the server. This defers the decision to the client but may result in extra
  files being downloaded.
* Extract a ManifestDescriptor class to make managing manifests easier.
* Add a template method AbstractManifestServlet.handleUnmatchedRequest to
  allow sub-classes the opportunity to intercept and handle the scenario
  where a permutation could not be matched.
* In AbstractManifestServlet, return a 404 response if unable to determine
  the appropriate manifest to serve rather than a 500.
* Promote several methods in AbstractManifestServlet from package access to
  protected access to make sub-classing easier.

## 0.6:

* Refactor ApplicationCache.swapCache to return a boolean value indicating
  whether the browser accepted request.
* Rename ApplicationCache.update to requestUpdate and make it return a
  boolean value indicating whether the browser accepted request.
* Remove "appcache_ignorable_permutation_properties" configuration property
  and use builtin mechanisms for determining selection properties.
* Generate a more complete Maven POM file.
* Compile against the last release of GWT 2.5.1 rather than the 2.6 RC1.
* Add javadoc packages to the build process.
* Update the client library to support the attempt to remove the local
  cache by re-requesting manifest with cookie disabling appcache set.
* Support disabling the application cache by setting a cookie named
  "appcache_disable" to "1".
* If the containing html page does not contain a manifest declaration
  then do not create a ApplicationCache in singleton.
* Add the file count and total file count fields to the ProgressEvent.
* Ensure that the file names declared in the manifest file are correctly
  encoded.
* Support pre 1.8 versions of gecko renderer when doing server side
  selection of the manifest file.

## 0.5:

* Convert ApplicationCache into an abstract class and merge in the code from
  the AbstractApplicationCache into ApplicationCache.
* Add tests to ensure event propagation behaviour and de-registration of
  handlers works correctly.

## 0.4:

* Split the server artifact into two so that the linker need not be included
  in the deployed artifact.
* Import the mGWT client code and start to refactor to make it easier to use
  within java based test frameworks.

## 0.3:

* Initial release
